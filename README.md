this my first restfull api services it's name is "Shop"
shop api its just Send and Reply structure api, it's with using jersey framework 
there is not html pages our ux/ui or any thing about fornt-end and database to sotre data we use just a CuncrrentHashMap to store data Temporarily in the memory
this it's just an experience for jax-rs api for developing restful api
and you could deploying this project and run it in the tomcat server v 10.0

how the app works!:
so in our application we can serve the client 3 services:

2-client can add a new customer by sending his data in JSON form and our server he store those data 
3-client can update informations about a customer Already exists that it :)
